# Lab 1 - Setting Up a Simple LAN

## 🚀 Overview
Welcome to Lab 1! In this lab, you'll set up a simple Local Area Network (LAN), assign IP addresses to PCs, and use simulation mode to test connectivity. Let's get started! 🎉

## 📌 What You'll Do
✅ Set up a basic LAN following the provided network diagram.
✅ Assign IP addresses to PCs.
✅ Use simulation mode to analyze network behavior.

## 🛠 Steps to Follow
### 1️⃣ Setting Up Your Network
- Arrange the devices as shown in the network diagram.
- Connect them properly within your workspace.

### 2️⃣ Assigning IP Addresses
- PC1: `192.168.1.X`
- PC2: `192.168.1.Y`
- (Replace `X` and `Y` with specific values from your lab instructions.)

### 3️⃣ Testing with Simulation Mode
- Use simulation mode to check how data packets travel.
- Run tests like `ping` to verify connectivity.
